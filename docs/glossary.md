## üë§ Hitters (Batters)

**1. AVG = H / AB**

- **Acronym:** _Batting Average_
- **Formula:** Hits √∑ At-Bats
- **Explanation:**
  - Tells you _how often a player gets a hit when they try_.
  - Example: If a batter has 2 hits in 5 at-bats, AVG = 0.400.
  - A good season AVG is around **.250‚Äì.300**.

---

**2. OBP = (H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP + SF)**

- **Acronym:** _On-Base Percentage_
- **Formula:** (Hits + Walks + Hit By Pitch) √∑ (At-Bats + Walks + Hit By Pitch + Sacrifice Flies)
- **Explanation:**
  - Measures _how often a player avoids making an out_.
  - Includes hits, walks, and times hit by a pitch ‚Äî _any way you can get on base_.
  - Typical OBP values: **.300 = average, .360+ = very good**.

---

**3. SLG = TB / AB**

- **Acronym:** _Slugging Percentage_
- **Formula:** Total Bases √∑ At-Bats
- **Total Bases (TB):**
  - Single = 1, Double = 2, Triple = 3, Home Run = 4.
  - Example: A player hits 1 double and 1 homer in 4 at-bats ‚Üí TB = 2 + 4 = 6 ‚Üí SLG = 6/4 = 1.500.
- **Explanation:**
  - Measures _power hitting_ ‚Äî how many bases you earn per hit.
  - Higher means more extra-base hits.

---

**4. OPS = OBP + SLG**

- **Acronym:** _On-base Plus Slugging_
- **Formula:** On-Base Percentage + Slugging Percentage
- **Explanation:**
  - A quick all-in-one stat for overall hitting ability.
  - Combines ‚Äúgetting on base‚Äù (OBP) and ‚Äúhitting for power‚Äù (SLG).
  - **.700 = average, .800 = good, .900+ = excellent, 1.000+ = elite**.

---

## ‚öæ Pitchers

**1. IP (float) = outs / 3**

- **Acronym:** _Innings Pitched_
- **Formula:** Outs √∑ 3
- **Explanation:**
  - Shows how many innings a pitcher threw.
  - 3 outs = 1 inning, 6 outs = 2 innings, etc.
  - Example: 19 outs = 6‚Öì innings = 6.33 IP.

---

**2. ERA = (ER \* 9) / IP**

- **Acronym:** _Earned Run Average_
- **Formula:** (Earned Runs √ó 9) √∑ Innings Pitched
- **Explanation:**
  - If this pitcher pitched a full 9-inning game, how many runs would they allow?
  - Lower is better.
  - Example: 3 ER in 6 innings ‚Üí (3√ó9)/6 = 4.50 ERA.
  - **Below 3.00 = excellent, 3.50‚Äì4.00 = average, 5.00+ = poor**.
- **Note:** Only ‚Äúearned‚Äù runs count (exclude errors).

---

**3. WHIP = (BB + H) / IP**

- **Acronym:** _Walks + Hits per Inning Pitched_
- **Formula:** (Walks + Hits Allowed) √∑ Innings Pitched
- **Explanation:**
  - Measures how many baserunners a pitcher allows per inning.
  - Lower is better.
  - Example: 5 hits + 2 walks in 6 IP ‚Üí 7 √∑ 6 = 1.17 WHIP.
  - **1.00 or less = excellent, ~1.30 = average, 1.50+ = bad**.
